Healthy, tasty and definitely smells so good.Oh and also, I totally forgot to mention, it uses flax seeds, which is quite honestly very rarely available these days but is so good for stomach issues, and the fact that it doesn't have a weird smell for all the mixed nuts is my favorite.

190,Aleena Xavier,Reviewed in India on 20 June 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Muesli review,"  I like the flavour and it tastes good. Out of various muesli brand that I have tried, I like yogabar muesli the most as it has a mix of nuts and seeds. The seeds and nuts together gives a crunchy experience. I am going to buy it again. What I don't like about it is the carbohydrate content in each serving. It's quite high when compared to protein content and I guess my main purpose for which I switched to muesli (i.e., weight loss) is not gonna be of great help in this regard.",pos,191,2020-06-20,6,2020

Quantum of whole grains 50% (rolled oats and brown rice flakes) and seeds 18% (quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax) seemed right and to my satisfaction.Cons: Quantum of dried fruits 22% (apricots, black currants, cranberries and raisins) and almonds is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.Conclusion: Overall, I like this muesli due to the main ingredients of whole grains and seeds and have ordered the seven hundred grams packet. To increase the dried fruit content, I have purchased the two hundred grams packet of 'Nutty Gritties Mix Berries' containing dried black currants, blueberries, strawberries and cranberries to mix with the muesli (I hope Nutty Gritties does not disappoint).I want to compare the above combination with Bagrry's Fruit 'n' Fibre, Mixed Fruit Muesli (consumed and enjoyed earlier) and decide which to settle for.Four stars for the main ingredients; one star docked for less dried fruits.",pos,254,2020-05-29,5,2020

320,Pooja Devlekar,Reviewed in India on 16 February 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing purchase.,"  I'm a big fan of Yogabar range of Mueslis and order them frequently. I decided to buy the 700 gm super saver pack when it was cheaper during the great Indian sale. Got it for Rs 349. However, the pack was full of lumps rather than the usual consistency. It was really annoying as it altered the taste a lot. All the lumps were overtly sweet and rest of the muesli was dry and tasteless. Moreover, they didn't dissolve in milk and by the time it did, the rest of the cereal got soggy. I really hope it was a one time thing and won't happen again in the future. I'm still waiting to hear from Yogabars.Hope this review is helpful.",pos,321,2020-02-16,2,2020

839,Shobhi,Reviewed in India on 1 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tasty and healthy snack.,"  This is a very good breakfast snack loaded with fruits, nuts, seeds and muesli which gives you long lasting energy for 4-5 hours continuously. it helps you to stay fit and lean without skipping any meal.Some of good things about it:1. It contains complex carbohydrates from quinoaz oats and brown rice. Hence, it will not increase your blood sugar level.2. It is very delicious and tasty. I bought strawberry flavour and I feel like eating ice cream.3. Flex and chia seeds contained in it gives you a good dose of fiber so you won't get problems like constipation.4. It is very high in protein so if if you're someone who wanted to build muscle mass then use this.",pos,840,2019-03-01,3,2019
840,PS...,Reviewed in India on 1 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome taste and a healthy breakfast option,"  Morning breakfast is now easy with this delicious crunchy muesli. Me being a fruits and nuts lover, loved it and it has all berries  which gives awesome taste. All healthy ingredients like oats, brown rice flakes, raisins, cranberries, apricots. Black currants ,quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax seeds, this is a combined mixture of all healthy foods. Just 200 calories and I am sorted in morning. Tastes best with cold milk. Even it makes a great dry snacking option anytime during the day. Perfect when you are on balanced diet and will recommend you all to give it a try.",pos,841,2019-03-01,3,2019

842,sameer Khan,Reviewed in India on 27 February 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,Loving it!!,"  I have been yogabar breakfast bars fan. So, I thought of giving the muesli a try. I was using kellogs muesli from a long time that tasted great but i was not liking huge corn flakes in it..So, at first the muesli taste was a little weird as i was used to diff muesli.. but second time onwards i liked the taste. It's great quality muesli.",pos,843,2019-02-27,2,2019
