Healthy, tasty and definitely smells so good.Oh and also, I totally forgot to mention, it uses flax seeds, which is quite honestly very rarely available these days but is so good for stomach issues, and the fact that it doesn't have a weird smell for all the mixed nuts is my favorite.

253,Madhur,Reviewed in India on 29 May 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD MUESLI / LESS DRIED FRUITS.,"  Pros: On opening the zip lock package, the aroma was just superb. Quantum of whole grains 50% (rolled oats and brown rice flakes) and seeds 18% (quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax) seemed right and to my satisfaction.Cons: Quantum of dried fruits 22% (apricots, black currants, cranberries and raisins) and almonds is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.Conclusion: Overall, I like this muesli due to the main ingredients of whole grains and seeds and have ordered the seven hundred grams packet. To increase the dried fruit content, I have purchased the two hundred grams packet of 'Nutty Gritties Mix Berries' containing dried black currants, blueberries, strawberries and cranberries to mix with the muesli (I hope Nutty Gritties does not disappoint).I want to compare the above combination with Bagrry's Fruit 'n' Fibre, Mixed Fruit Muesli (consumed and enjoyed earlier) and decide which to settle for.Four stars for the main ingredients; one star docked for less dried fruits.",29-05-20,May,2020,254,4,158,988,,          Helpful,0.00E+00,

320,Pooja Devlekar,Reviewed in India on 16 February 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing purchase.,"  I'm a big fan of Yogabar range of Mueslis and order them frequently. I decided to buy the 700 gm super saver pack when it was cheaper during the great Indian sale. Got it for Rs 349. However, the pack was full of lumps rather than the usual consistency. It was really annoying as it altered the taste a lot. All the lumps were overtly sweet and rest of the muesli was dry and tasteless. Moreover, they didn't dissolve in milk and by the time it did, the rest of the cereal got soggy. I really hope it was a one time thing and won't happen again in the future. I'm still waiting to hear from Yogabars.Hope this review is helpful.",16-02-20,February,2020,321,2,121,630,,"One person found this helpful

I use it to slightly flavor my oatmeal in morning as it contains sugar in indirect forms like date oil, rice barn oil. So weight loss targeting people must limit this as it'll definitely spike insulin. Keep your sugar intake within 30g/day.
