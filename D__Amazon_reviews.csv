Amazon Customer,Reviewed in India on 8 September 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells tasyea,"  It's been two whole days now and the taste of this cereal is so refreshing that I don't feel the need to munch on anything else throughout the day. Healthy, tasty and definitely smells so good.Oh and also, I totally forgot to mention, it uses flax seeds, which is quite honestly very rarely available these days but is so good for stomach issues, and the fact that it doesn't have a weird smell for all the mixed nuts is my favorite. Loving it. Gonna try different flavors next month!"

Khilendra Kumar sen,Reviewed in India on 24 August 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not a healthy food at all. Too much sugar syrup taste that dominates other natural flavours,  Just too much sugar to my taste. Its doubtful if its all natural sugar or processed. It is more of a comfort food and less of a healthy food. The food should have been natural and not candied out in syrup. I was not expecting this from a brand that has Yoga in its name. Dissappointed

Navi,Reviewed in India on 11 July 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Perfect Start to the Day!!,  This is one brand that hasn’t compromised on it’s quality by adding cornflakes. That’s something am super happy about 😊.The mix of cereals and fruits n nuts are perfect. The chia seeds are a good addition. The quality has been as good as it was initially. Good flavour. The packaging is excellent too.
Sushsmitha,Reviewed in India on 11 July 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Little bit Costly, But make my Day..",  It's really tasty and adds flavour to my regular tasteless Oats along with fruits and Jaggery.Being a regular user I feel its price (MRP) could've been less.. hope they'll do something good for Bachelors like me..The product is very fresh and adds jinx to my boring Breakfast..

Aleena Xavier,Reviewed in India on 20 June 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Muesli review,"  I like the flavour and it tastes good. Out of various muesli brand that I have tried, I like yogabar muesli the most as it has a mix of nuts and seeds. The seeds and nuts together gives a crunchy experience. I am going to buy it again. What I don't like about it is the carbohydrate content in each serving. It's quite high when compared to protein content and I guess my main purpose for which I switched to muesli (i.e., weight loss) is not gonna be of great help in this regard."

Madhur,Reviewed in India on 29 May 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD MUESLI / LESS DRIED FRUITS.,"  Pros: On opening the zip lock package, the aroma was just superb. Quantum of whole grains 50% (rolled oats and brown rice flakes) and seeds 18% (quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax) seemed right and to my satisfaction.Cons: Quantum of dried fruits 22% (apricots, black currants, cranberries and raisins) and almonds is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.Conclusion: Overall, I like this muesli due to the main ingredients of whole grains and seeds and have ordered the seven hundred grams packet. To increase the dried fruit content, I have purchased the two hundred grams packet of 'Nutty Gritties Mix Berries' containing dried black currants, blueberries, strawberries and cranberries to mix with the muesli (I hope Nutty Gritties does not disappoint).I want to compare the above combination with Bagrry's Fruit 'n' Fibre, Mixed Fruit Muesli (consumed and enjoyed earlier) and decide which to settle for.Four stars for the main ingredients; one star docked for less dried fruits."

But I do not have good experience as regard to quality. It is for sure, not having 22% of fruit and nut. Which was the main reason for me to go for it leaving Baggery. Perhaps Yogabar people are intending to do cost cutting by adding less while promising more. I can not return as per product return policy."

Pooja Devlekar,Reviewed in India on 16 February 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing purchase.,"  I'm a big fan of Yogabar range of Mueslis and order them frequently. I decided to buy the 700 gm super saver pack when it was cheaper during the great Indian sale. Got it for Rs 349. However, the pack was full of lumps rather than the usual consistency. It was really annoying as it altered the taste a lot. All the lumps were overtly sweet and rest of the muesli was dry and tasteless. Moreover, they didn't dissolve in milk and by the time it did, the rest of the cereal got soggy. I really hope it was a one time thing and won't happen again in the future. I'm still waiting to hear from Yogabars.Hope this review is helpful."

yellow,Reviewed in India on 20 August 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"  Received the product safely without damage. Product was fresh according to pkd date. I use it to slightly flavor my oatmeal in morning as it contains sugar in indirect forms like date oil, rice barn oil. So weight loss targeting people must limit this as it'll definitely spike insulin. Keep your sugar intake within 30g/day. Press the helpful button."

I'd have preferred a more crunchy texture but it isn't so bad. Ingredients used seem to be of good quality especially the raisins but are a bit too large for my liking. The packaging is really good. The muesli is in a resealable pouch with one transparent side which helps check the level of cereal remaining

It contains complex carbohydrates from quinoaz oats and brown rice. Hence, it will not increase your blood sugar level.2. It is very delicious and tasty. I bought strawberry flavour and I feel like eating ice cream.3. Flex and chia seeds contained in it gives you a good dose of fiber so you won't get problems like constipation.4. It is very high in protein so if if you're someone who wanted to build muscle mass then use this."

The presence of rich nuts and dried fruits along with cranberries, apricots and other ingredients make a perfect super lovely breakfast for me. It makes my stomach full and also make me stay fit. Thanks to yogabar for such amazing healthy food"
sameer Khan,Reviewed in India on 27 February 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,Loving it!!,"  I have been yogabar breakfast bars fan. So, I thought of giving the muesli a try. I was using kellogs muesli from a long time that tasted great but i was not liking huge corn flakes in it..So, at first the muesli taste was a little weird as i was used to diff muesli.. but second time onwards i liked the taste. It's great quality muesli."

Ranadheep,Reviewed in India on 18 February 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,good quality ingredients.,"  I have tried yogabar cereal bars and they were great, good quality ingredients and not too sweet. I stumbled upon their Muesli and as per Swiss Muesli style. It turned to be great."
Jay,Reviewed in India on 17 February 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,A truly homegrown cereal,"  I have been a regular consumer of cerals over the past few years and have tasted quite a few. Viz. Dorset, kellogs muesli etc. Yoga is quite a healthy mix of seeds, oats fruits and overall likeable to the Indian palate. Would wish for a higher portion of fruit. Would rate it 4 stars over the other Indian cereals available."

My favourite is the chocolate version but everyone in the family prefers different flavours. They are all delicious and healthy. I'm happy to have found a great breakfast option.
