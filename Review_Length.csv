4,Amazon Customer,"  It's been two whole days now and the taste of this cereal is so refreshing that I don't feel the need to munch on anything else throughout the day. Healthy, tasty and definitely smells so good.Oh and also, I totally forgot to mention, it uses flax seeds, which is quite honestly very rarely available these days but is so good for stomach issues, and the fact that it doesn't have a weird smell for all the mixed nuts is my favorite. Loving it. Gonna try different flavors next month!",4.0,89,486

The seeds and nuts together gives a crunchy experience. I am going to buy it again. What I don't like about it is the carbohydrate content in each serving. It's quite high when compared to protein content and I guess my main purpose for which I switched to muesli (i.e., weight loss) is not gonna be of great help in this regard.",4.0,94,483

253,Madhur,"  Pros: On opening the zip lock package, the aroma was just superb. Quantum of whole grains 50% (rolled oats and brown rice flakes) and seeds 18% (quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax) seemed right and to my satisfaction.Cons: Quantum of dried fruits 22% (apricots, black currants, cranberries and raisins) and almonds is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.Conclusion: Overall, I like this muesli due to the main ingredients of whole grains and seeds and have ordered the seven hundred grams packet. To increase the dried fruit content, I have purchased the two hundred grams packet of 'Nutty Gritties Mix Berries' containing dried black currants, blueberries, strawberries and cranberries to mix with the muesli (I hope Nutty Gritties does not disappoint).I want to compare the above combination with Bagrry's Fruit 'n' Fibre, Mixed Fruit Muesli (consumed and enjoyed earlier) and decide which to settle for.Four stars for the main ingredients; one star docked for less dried fruits.",4.0,158,988

Got it for Rs 349. However, the pack was full of lumps rather than the usual consistency. It was really annoying as it altered the taste a lot. All the lumps were overtly sweet and rest of the muesli was dry and tasteless. Moreover, they didn't dissolve in milk and by the time it did, the rest of the cereal got soggy. I really hope it was a one time thing and won't happen again in the future. I'm still waiting to hear from Yogabars.Hope this review is helpful.",2.0,121,630

So I was thrilled when I not only found it on Amazon, but at a cheaper price than the local shop.The item was delivered on time, as described, and I love it so much, I'm repeatedly keeping it in stock. It's oaty, with great amount of nuts & dried fruit to boot. I use it for daily cereal for breakfast, and my mother in law loves it with warm milk.Thanks again, Amazon - and Yoga Bar!",5.0,110,555
